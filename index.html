            <h2>Small team. No overhead. Real results.</h2>
            <p>Too many agencies specialize in one thing and outsource the rest. You end up managing five vendors to run one campaign. We started C41 to fix that.</p>
            <p>We're a full-service creative team based in Utah. Video, ads, web, social, brand. One team handles it all, so everything works together. No layers of account managers between you and the people doing the work.</p>
            <p>Over $5 million in revenue generated for our clients. 9.5 million views on a single campaign. We measure success by your bottom line, not our portfolio.</p>

            <span class="small-label">Frequently Asked</span>
            <h2>Questions we get a lot.</h2>

        <div class="faq-list">
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>How much does a project cost?</summary>
                <p>It depends on scope. A single video project might start around $3,000-5,000. A full campaign with video, ads, web, and content strategy could range from $10,000-25,000+. We'll always give you a clear quote before any work starts, and we'll tell you honestly if your budget doesn't match your goals.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What makes C41 different from other agencies?</summary>
                <p>Most agencies do one thing well and outsource the rest. You end up managing multiple vendors for one campaign. We handle video, ads, web, social, and brand under one roof. One team, one point of contact, everything built to work together. And we're small enough that you talk directly to the people doing the work.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>How long does a typical project take?</summary>
                <p>A single video: 2-4 weeks from kickoff to delivery. A website: 3-6 weeks. A full campaign with multiple deliverables: 4-8 weeks. We'll give you a clear timeline upfront and we stick to it.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Do you work with clients outside Utah?</summary>
                <p>Yes. We're based in Utah but work with brands everywhere. For video production that requires on-location shooting, we travel. For everything else (ads, web, social, strategy, consulting), location doesn't matter.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Do I need to know what I need, or can you help figure that out?</summary>
                <p>That's literally what the discovery call is for. Most clients come to us knowing something isn't working but not sure exactly what to do. We'll look at your current situation, identify the biggest opportunities, and recommend what will actually move the needle. No obligation.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Can you just do one thing, or do I have to buy a full package?</summary>
                <p>You can hire us for anything individually: just a video, just a website, just ad management. But the real value is when everything works together. We'll never pressure you into more than you need.</p>
